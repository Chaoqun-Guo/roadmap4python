# Python Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of learning Python. It will include:

- Notes on Python concepts and syntax
- Code snippets demonstrating Python features
- Mini projects and exercises to practice Python skills
- Resources and references for further learning

The goal of this repository is not only to track my progress, but also to serve as a resource for other Python learners. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
